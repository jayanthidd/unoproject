    <h1>UNO Game Rules</h1>
    
    <div id="setup">
      <h2>Setup</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The game is for 2-10 players</li>
        <li>Every player starts with seven cards, and they are dealt face down. The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile face down. </li>
        <li>The top card should be placed in the Discard Pile, and the game begins!</li>
      </ul>
            
    </div>
    
    <div id="main-content">

      <h2>Game Play</h2>
    
      <p>The first player is normally the player to the left of the dealer (you can also choose the youngest player) and gameplay usually follows a clockwise direction. Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.

        You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. For instance, if the Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have to place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it. You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).
        
        If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match, they must draw a card from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep the card, and the game moves on to the next person in turn. You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn. </p>
    
      <h2>End Of Game</h2>
    
      <p class="thinParagraph floatLeft">The game continues until a player has one card left. The moment a player has just one card they must yell “UNO!”. If they are caught not saying “Uno” by another player before the next player has taken their turn, that player must draw two new cards as a penalty. Assuming that the player is unable to play/discard their last card and needs to draw, but after drawing, is then able to play/discard that penultimate card, the player has to repeat the action of calling out “Uno”. The bottom line is – Announcing “Uno” needs to be repeated every time you are left with one card.

        Once a player has no cards remaining, the game round is over, points are scored, and the game begins over again.</p>

      <h2>Action Cards</h2>

      <h4>Reverse</h4>

      <p>If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise or vice versa. It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Reverse card. If turned up at the beginning of play, the dealer goes first, and the player to the dealer’s right is next (normally it would be the player to the dealer’s left).</p>

      <h4>Skip </h4>

      <p>When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn. It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Skip card. If turned up at the beginning of play, the first player (to the dealer’s left) loses his/her turn. The next player to that player’s right starts the game instead.</p>
